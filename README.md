NoJS Vite + Tailwind CSS Starter
====

## Motivation

Tailwind CSS is quite popular for building interfaces, so developers might benefit of using the starter template for quick prototyping.

Unfortunately, the official Create Vite tool doesn't have a Tailwind template [yet](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/9304).

## When to use

1. When you need to develop a pure HTML/CSS prototype.
2. When you import a standalone version of a JS framework right through HTML.

## How to use

```bash
npx degit kometolabs/vite-tailwind-starter my-tailwind-app
cd my-tailwind-app
pnpm i || yarn || npm i
pnpm run dev || yarn dev || npm run dev
```

**Happy coding!**
